Example 1:

Input: A = ["cba","daf","ghi"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
After choosing D = {1}, each column ["c","d","g"] and ["a","f","i"] are in non-decreasing sorted order.
If we chose D = {}, then a column ["b","a","h"] would not be in non-decreasing sorted order.

Example 2:

Input: A = ["a","b"]
Output: 0
Explanation: D = {}

Example 3:

Input: A = ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
Output: 3
Explanation: D = {0, 1, 2}
